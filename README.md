This project presents an approach to a dance training system assisted by motion capture technology that specifically focuses on the dance style of hip-hop. The purpose of this project is to accurately teach dancers and non-dancers the proper techniques and movements of hip hop as some styles within hip-hop require an accurate execution of the dance techniques. 

These dance movements were obtained by motion capture and were applied to digital characters which would perform the choreography that was captured.

The inspiration of this project is based upon the author’s own personal experience as a hip hop dancer who competes as part of a crew for Trinity College Dublin in yearly intervarsity competitions with other Irish universities. 

A research questionnaire was distributed to gather opinions from the dance community regarding the integration of dance with technology. A total of 130 participants took part in the questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire were used as a tool to support and motivate the project. 

At the end of this project, a hip-hop dance training system that is assisted by motion capture data was successfully created that is easy to use and can be used by everyone regardless of their levels of dance expertise.
